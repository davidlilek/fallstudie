## QC and selecting cells for further analysis

* Visualize QC metrics as a violin plot

```{r}
# The [[ operator can add columns to object metadata. This is a great place to stash QC stats
pbmc[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(pbmc, pattern = "^MT-")
# Visualize QC metrics as a violin plot
VlnPlot(pbmc, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"), ncol = 3)
```

* FeatureScatter is typically used to visualize feature-feature relationships, but can be used for anything calculated by the object, i.e. columns in object metadata, PC scores etc.

```{r}
# FeatureScatter is typically used to visualize feature-feature relationships, but can be used
# for anything calculated by the object, i.e. columns in object metadata, PC scores etc.

# Normalizing the data

```{r}

```{r}

# Determine the ‘dimensionality’ of the dataset

```{r}

# approximate techniques such as those implemented in ElbowPlot() can be used to reduce

# If you haven't installed UMAP, you can do so via reticulate::py_install(packages =
